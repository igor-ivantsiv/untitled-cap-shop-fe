## Description
The "Untitled" cap store is an online based webshop where users can browse a variety of caps in different styles and colors. The app includes everything that is expected from a webshop. Users can browse the shop, add something to their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout to order their products. For the owner of the shop, there is also an easy to use dashboard for managing product stock, adding, removing or updating products, and managing the orders. Finally, users have access to a live chat where they can have instant access to a customer service member in real time via direct messages, for any questions or problems they might face.
The app is made with React, integrated with an Express.js backend and MongoDB database.
